But for the uninitiated, Crokinole is like a mashup of Shuffleboard and Curling, played on a tabletop board. It’s been around since the 19th century, but has been seen a steady rise in global popularity in recent years."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>A super quick overview of the game:</strong> Players take turns flicking discs towards the center of the board, aiming to land in the higher-scoring zones while knocking opponent discs to lower-scoring zones (or completely off). If an opponent’s disc is on the board, a shot must hit an opponent’s disc to remain in play. Otherwise, the disc must land within the inner circle (or score a 20 in the center hole). Whoever has more points at the end of the round wins the round. Games consist of multiple rounds. <a href=https://youtu.be/R-6hdqdYPpE target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Watch this video</a> for a more thorough rules explanation."}]}]}
