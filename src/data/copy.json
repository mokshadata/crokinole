A shot must hit an opponent’s disc if one is present; otherwise, it must land in the inner circle (or score a 20 in the center hole). The round winner is whoever has the most points, and games consist of multiple rounds. <a href=https://youtu.be/R-6hdqdYPpE target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Watch this video</a> for a more thorough rules explanation."},{"type":"text","value":"(idea- could expand this and do some lingo/visual glossary showing terms/shots on a real 3d board or videos)"},{"type":"text","value":"Here are top players over the past decade:"},{"type":"img","value":{"src":"assets/images/bump.png","alt":"bump chart"}},{"type":"text","value":"Connor Reinman, the back-to-back world champion, and Justin Slater, the perennial powerhouse, are arguably the greatest players on the Crokinole world stage right now."},{"type":"text","value":"But how good are they?

On average, a top competitive player makes around 55% of their open 20s."},{"type":"text","value":"For these players, making 8 straight open 20s in live-game action should happen only about 1 in every 120 rounds.

Something about ricochets…, in reality your opponent’s play closes the door far too often. So we are more likely to see this happen when two great players go against eachother."},{"type":"text","value":"Looking at the results, there were only X times an individual had a chance at 8 in a row, and Y times it happened. For double perfect rounds, Y times out of Z total rounds. But the dreams are dashed even sooner for this.
