A shot must hit an opponent’s disc if one is present; otherwise, it must land in the inner circle (or score a 20 in the center hole). The round winner is whoever has the most points, and games consist of multiple rounds. <a href=https://youtu.be/R-6hdqdYPpE target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Watch this video</a> for a more thorough rules explanation."},{"type":"text","value":"(could expand this and do some lingo/visual glossary showing terms/shots on a real 3d board or videos)"},{"type":"text","value":"So back to our players… Slater and Reinman - two titans of the Crokinole game right now.
